        <h2>About the Pike Fish</h2>
        <p>The Pike Fish, scientifically known as Esox lucius, is a predatory fresh water fish that inhabits lakes and
            rivers throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Surely, an apex predator with an elongated body, sharp teeth, and
            camouflaged skin.</p>

        <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
        <p>Pike fish are generally from 40 to 55 inches in length and weigh more than 55 pounds. They have an olive
            green overall color, light-colored oval-shaped spots on the sides, and dorsal fins way in the back of their
            body, near their tail.</p>

        <h3>Habitat and Distribution</h3>
        <p>Pike fish inhabit lakes, rivers, and ponds with slow or no flow. They prefer clear water with an abundance of
            vegetation to offer cover and hunting ground. The species is distributed throughout North America, Europe,
            and Asia. </p>

        <h3>Diet and Feeding Habits</h3>
        <p>The pike is a carnivorous predator that feeds on different types of prey, from smaller fish to amphibians and
            sometimes birds or small mammals. It has sharp teeth and can achieve fast accelerations to ambush and catch
            prey..</p>

        <h3>Behavior and Social Structure</h3>
        <p>Pike fish are basically solitary and territorial. These are ambushing predators resting motionless in weed,
            camouflaging, and then rushing swiftly with a burst of speed in attacks upon the passing prey.</p>

        <h3>Conservation Status</h3>
        <p>Currently, the Pike Fish is not considered endangered and has a stable population in most of its range.
            However, habitat degradation and pollution can impact local populations. Conservation efforts focus on
            maintaining clean and healthy freshwater ecosystems.</p>

        <h3>Interesting Facts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pike Fish can live up to 10-15 years in the wild.</li>
            <li>They have been known to exhibit cannibalistic behavior, especially in crowded conditions.</li>
            <li>Pike has excellent vision, helping in viewing the food many yards away.</li>
            <li>In folklore, Pike are commonly referred to as "water wolves" because of their predatory nature.</li>

        <h2>About the Salmon Fish</h2>
        <p>The Salmon Fish belongs to one of the most widespread fish species in the Northern part of the Atlantic Ocean
            and its rivers. Salmon have an incredible life cycle for migration from freshwater to saltwater back to
            freshwater to spawn.</p>

        <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
        <p>Salmon Fish are usually around 28-30 inches long and weigh up to 12 pounds. They are silver-blue in color
            with a somewhat forked tail and small black spots on the gill covers and back.</p>

        <h3>Habitat and Distribution</h3>
        <p>Salmon Fish are found in both freshwater and saltwater environments. Born in freshwater rivers, they then
            migrate to the ocean only to return to their birthplace to spawn. Their distribution covers the northern
            parts of the Atlantic Ocean and the adjacent rivers.</p>

        <h3>Diet and Feeding Habits</h3>
        <p>The salmon fish is a carnivorous predator that feeds on various prey, such as smaller fish, crustaceans, and
            insects. In freshwater, young salmon feed on main aquatic insects and plankton; the adults in the ocean feed
            on fish and squid.</p>

        <h3>Behavior and Social Structure</h3>
        <p>Salmon Fish have typical patterns of migration. They tend to make journeys of even thousands of miles from
            their homes in freshwater rivers out to the ocean and back to spawn. They manifest in an aggressive manner
            during the spawning season, controlled by the urge to establish territory and ensure successful
            reproduction.</p>

        <h3>Conservation Status</h3>
        <p>Salmon fish populations are threatened by overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Habitat
            restoration programs, sustainable methods of fishing, and protection of spawning grounds are contemplated
            for the sake of sustaining salmon fish populations.</p>

        <h3>Interesting Facts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Salmon Fish have a highly developed sense of smell, which helps them navigate back to their place of
                birth to spawn</li>
            <li>Salmon are capable of jumping up to 12 feet high in overcoming any obstacles during their migration.
            </li>
            <li>Salmon change color during their life cycle; spawning salmon change into bright red.</li>
            <li>Salmon provide for many indigenous cultures both culturally and economically.</li>
        </ul>
